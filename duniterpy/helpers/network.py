    Get available nodes grouped and sorted by descending blockstamp

    Each entry is a list of nodes (HeadV2 instance, inline endpoint list) sharing the same blockstamp:

        [
            [{"head": HeadV2, "endpoints": [str, ...]}, ...],
            [{"head": HeadV2, "endpoints": [str, ...]}, ...],

    If node is down, you can select another node.

    Warning : only nodes with BMAS, BASIC_MERKLED_API, GVA and GVASUB endpoint are selected
              and only those endpoints are available in the endpoint list
